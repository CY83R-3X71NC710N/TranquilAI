# Project Restructuring Complete

## Summary

Successfully restructured the macOS AI Wallpaper Generator project to:

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Removed Google Imagen-3 Integration**
   - Eliminated all Imagen-3 related code, functions, and dependencies
   - Removed engine selection logic and CLI arguments
   - Cleaned up all references to IMAGEN_DIR, IMAGEN_SCRIPT, etc.

2. **Implemented Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Enhancement**
   - Added `enhance_prompt_with_gemini()` function using the Google Generative AI Python client
   - Integrated prompt enhancement as a preprocessing step before Pollinations generation
   - Added proper error handling and fallback to original prompts

3. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Single AI engine: Pollinations (with Flux model)
   - Optional prompt enhancement via Gemini 2.5 Pro
   - Maintained all existing features: multi-display support, wallpaper setting, queue system

4. **Updated Dependencies and Setup**
   - Auto-installation of `google-generativeai` and `python-dotenv`
   - Created `.env.example` file for easy API key setup
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing setup scripts

5. **Updated Documentation**
   - Completely rewrote README.md to reflect new architecture
   - Added comprehensive examples and troubleshooting
   - Included privacy information and migration notes

6. **Preserved All Core Features**
   - Multi-display support with auto-detection
   - High-quality wallpaper generation (up to 5K resolution)
   - Multiple wallpaper setting methods (wallpaper-cli, m-cli, AppleScript)
   - Queue system with timestamped files
   - Private mode for minimal parameter usage
   - Flexible CLI with all necessary options

### ✅ Testing Results

- [x] Script syntax validation passed
- [x] CLI help output correct
- [x] Private mode generation working
- [x] Standard mode with Gemini fallback working
- [x] Image download and file handling functional
- [x] Queue system creating timestamped files correctly

### 🎯 Final Architecture

```
User Prompt → [Gemini 2.5 Pro Enhancement (optional)] → Pollinations API → High-Quality Wallpaper → macOS Desktop
```

**Features:**
- **Engine**: Pollinations AI with Flux model (only)
- **Enhancement**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (optional, requires API key)
- **Privacy**: `--private` flag skips enhancement and uses minimal parameters
- **Quality**: Up to 5K resolution, professional image generation
- **Compatibility**: Works on all macOS versions with Python 3.6+
